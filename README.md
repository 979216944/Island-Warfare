## CSE Capstone Team 4 Website (4 Fun) 

### Description of project

Our project is an Magic Leap AR "island colonization" video game where the player attempts to take over floating islands by defeating enemies. The player can switch between a high-level overview of the world where they distribute units to different floating islands and a low-level view where they actually walk onto the island and watch the battle themselves.

    - I am a senior in computer science at UW Settle, but I'm initially from the Bay Area in California. I grew up loving playing video games ranging from Halo to Pokemon and have been interested in game development for a while. I've made some games on my own but am excited to work on a team to creating a game in AR. When I was younger I loved games from the "Command and Conquer" series and am excited to make a strategy game of our own.
